# Fallen-London-Sell-All
Adds additonal options to the bazaar sell tab in Fallen London

## Stuff I want to be part of this extension

- Add a button to when you are selling items that fills in the max amount of items you own of that type.

- A button next to sell that just does whats listen above

- or maybe just a bunch of checkboxes and then sell all of the checked items

- Auto check all items of a certain value. And maybe also below that value of option is checked
